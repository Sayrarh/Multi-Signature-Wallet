# Multi-Signature-Wallet
Multi-signature wallets (or multi-sig wallets) are crypto wallets that require two or more private keys to sign and confirm a transaction.

The number of signatures required to sign a transaction is dependent on the kind of multi-sig wallet.

A multi-sig wallet requires at least 80% of the owners of the wallet to approve a transaction before a transaction is executed.


The wallet owners can;

1. Submit a transaction
3. Approve and revoke approval of pending transcations
5. Anyone can execute a transaction after enough owners has approved it.
